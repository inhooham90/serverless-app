# Serverless App

This is a practice project to learn and build serverless websites. This website is made with Nodejs, Serverless, S3, Webpack, DynamoDB, Lambda, and etc.

## Functionality

Currently, there exists two lambda functions that works as API endpoints.

1. Creating user - Creates user with email and name
2. Gets user - Gets user info that's in the database.

I'm not too sure what this web app will become.
